### Decision Trees

- To represent data mining models
    - The results of our data mining
- Directed and clear box technique
    - Look inside the model and get some insight
- Can be employed for:
    - Classification (target values are discrete)
    - Estimation (Target values are continuous)
    - Prediction (Target values are in the future)
- Widely applied to directed mining because:
    - Not fussy about data
    - Relitively easy to understand, good for communicating to people

### DT (decision trees) for classification

- Having built the decision tree
- We can classify new individuals
    - For whom we don't know the correct classifcition
- By using their attribute values to trace through the tree to the leaf node
