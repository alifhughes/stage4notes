# ISAD353 - From SQL to NoSql
> Date: 31-10-16

### Historical

- Movement to NoSQL happened in conjunction with object oriental programming and the take of the internet
- ACID transaction process (Atomic, consistent, Isolated and durable)

### Relational databases

- The relational model data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row
    - Rows are also called records

**Benefits:**

- Persistence
- Integration
- Transactions
- SQL
- Reporting

### Impedance mismatch

- Problem arises with the way organise data into a database
- Data is split too much
- Inability to match an object in the real world to a single table or place

### Important papers

- Google file system -> Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)
- Google Map Reduce  -> Map Reduce
- Google big table   -> HBase

### NoSQL

- Non-relational
- Cluster friendly
- Open source
- Internet

### Apache Hadoop

- A software library that allows for the distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers using simple programming modules
- It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, earch offering local computation and storage

### Components

- Data storage and management -> HDFS
- Processing and computation -> Map reduce
