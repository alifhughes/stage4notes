### Linear Regression

- Fits a line through numeric data
- Suppose that we have known numeric data points
    - These points are in effect our training set
- A straight line has a formula y = a + bx
- Line is not persistantly bias at over or under estimating the value of y

### Residuals and the best fit

- In ordinary least squares regression the 'best fit' is provided by the line that minimses the expression
- `R1^2 + R2^2+...+Rn^2
