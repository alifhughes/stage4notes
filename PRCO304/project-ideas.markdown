### Project Ideas

#### Networked music creation software
- Simple sequencer online
- two people can access the same page and same session and create music together
- Techniques
    - locking
        - could lock each of the individual buttons when the user clicks on it
    - Event passing
        - Operation transformation
        - Creating a snapshot of the state

to do:
- Use node
    - get started with
- Read the blogs on OT

IDEA: have users log in, then maybe can start a forum or something and pair people with other people based on the music they want to make
- make sandbox-y as much as possible
    - They should be in control and allow freedom



##### Database
- Predifined presets that can be loaded in
- they can tweak and save them
- _(potentially)_ store the operations of the user
- The songs that have been created can be downloaded


#### AI music generation
- decision based music generation (follow tutorial)

#### Social media scrapper for finding new music
- give it twitter, facebook credentials
- it finds new music, djs and everything that is based on your likes
- AI to get better at finding what you like
