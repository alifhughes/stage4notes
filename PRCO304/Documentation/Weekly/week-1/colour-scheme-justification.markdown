## Colour scheme justification

For my project. I wish the app to be inviting to the new user, for it to be simple and not daunting. To do this, I need a colour scheme that matches. I also want to keep my colour scheme simple. It should consist only of a base colour, a complementing colour, Light grey, Dark grey and white. I want this for a number of reasons: It is easier to implement having only a select few to choose from, it has consistency and it gives a professional feeling. The colours need to reflect welcoming, not be intrusive as to distract from the creative process, positive, and incourage long-working times.

Candidates for base colour:-

Orange
    - More welcoming than red, fairly neutral, doesn't hold significant other theories

light orange: FFCC34 and blue 3C3CB7

### The results and finalisation

The clear winner from the results of the questionnaire was number 4 of the questionnaire: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCz9ttLCYX4pm6sa06F8O36dSV35wIyCTi7_2E8kLRc/edit?usp=sharing
This was the blue and orange. I am happy to accept this as my colour scheme as it represents the most inviting complementing colours. I would have also liked blue and red because it gives the impression of more professionalism but as my project is catered for more of creative type of people and for beginners I feel like this is a fair comprimise.
From the blue, I created harmonising greys so that my final colour pallete, of which I will restrict all colours on my website too, consist of blue, orange, dark grey, light grey and white.

I am happy with the outcome of these colour pallete. It is simple enough for me to implement, it keeps the site consistent, and it gives off impressions of inviting creativeness at any level, which is exactly what I wanted.
