### Laboratory assignment

##### Laboratory report

- What is the task
- How i solve it
- What does it mean

- **Eplain**
- How does changing number samples, bins effect what you see
- Guassian adding no tegether, doesn't matter what limit they tend to go to a guassain form 
- what constitutes a sensible choice
- model data by estimate parameters

### 1D linear regression

Techniques used are good for optimisation of networks
Best fit line

- How do find the M and C in y = mx + c

### Least squares fitting

- sum of the squared errors trying to minimise
- find the rate of change of error
- find value of m which will give best fit
- differeniate ei

### Matlab matrices

##### Multiplication of a matrix

- In general if A i s an m x n matrix with typical element aij then the product of a number k with A is written kA and has the corresponding elements kaij
- all values get multiplied by that number

##### Using matrices to represent equations

- represent the co-effecients
