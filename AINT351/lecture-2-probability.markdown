# Some more on probability

### Marginalisation
- what is the prob. of x = p and y = q
    - x = 0 AND x = 1
![marginalisation-example-table](img/marginalisation-example-table.png)\

- can sum up the variables for x if you don't care about the other variable
    - x = 1 = the sum of all rows of x=1

### Conditional probability: Bayes rule
- Joint distribution of A and B
- prob. of A multiplied by the prob. of B given that A has occoured
![conditional-prob-formula](img/conditional-prob-formula.png)\

- If A and B are not independant events
    - The relationship is true
- The first events outcome effects the second event

- If they are independant events
    - The relationship is only true if A and B are independent
- The first event's outcome doesn't effect the prob of second's
- prob of a multipled b or b
