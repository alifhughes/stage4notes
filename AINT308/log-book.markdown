# AINT308 - Log book

- Adjust owlcentre.py
- Initial values:
    - 1545, 1420, 1545, 1560 1530
- adjusted values:
    - 1545, 1430, 1545, 1560 1500

### What to do for first assignment

- Copy owl 1 to own project
- Delete 2nd half
- Put procedure in there to move eyes, pause, repeat
    - Create flow charts to work out to do
    - Structured approach

- Make both eyes focus on one thing
- Move them left to right in sinusoul manner for smooth
- comeleon does different
- emotive eye
    - Rolling eyes
    - shifty

- 24 byte string of cursor values
- Sent to pfcsocket
- It moves to that location

### Practical 1

- Set up ssh to owl
- Use controls to move eyes
- pressed c for cross correlation
- adjusted eye and neck positions to make centre
- downloaded fresh project
- Put in new values into fresh project
- Deleted second loop and "c" case

### Practical 2

- Work out the sin calculation
- (sin(time) * the scale) + the base limit
- If not do it the easy way
- Chamelon eyes is already done
    - Take the keys
    - use key name in single quotes e.g. 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd'
    - Find out the key codes for four other keys
    - Make them control all left/right movements
    - The arrow keys does the same
- Emotive eye movement
    - Can make them roll
    - Copy cockroach or dragonfly
- Neck movement is working as desired
- Eye movement is working but need to calculate the triangles geometry as the point of focus moves from left to right
- Chamelon eye movement working with key presses
    - Now making work with random numbers and it moves towards those individually

### Practical 3

- 1120 = b
- 2000 = t
- 1890 = r
- 1200 = l
